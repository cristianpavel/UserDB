Mini app that allows users to start and end sessions (to simulate
an work environment). The sessions are stored in an Elastic Search 
DB. Front-end is written in AngluarJS and
back-end in node js.

Using those sessions, some statistics are desplayed such as
a Line chart seeing the last N sessions of a user or
a date histogram showing the time spent at work in a
time range.
